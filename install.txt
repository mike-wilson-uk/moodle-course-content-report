1. To install unzip the gsb.zip file, then two folders (admin and blocks)to the root moodle folder.

2. Next log into Moodle as an administrator and visit: http:/your-moodle-address/admin  which will install the gsb block.

3. You're now good to go. From the administrators menu go to: Reports > Gold, Silver, Bronze Admin. You'll see a summary of your moodle which will be zeroed to start with. 
   You will need to select each of the categories in the drop down category list and press "Process GSB Medals". You will be taken back to the main admin screen after you process each category, you will see a confirmation message of the last category processed and the GSB summary will increase.
   You should process all categories before attempting to download the GSB report.

4. The GSB block can be added to courses in the normal way.

5. The following html file is linked to the GSB block and gives teachers an explanation of what the GSB medal means, how to improve it and who to contact in your institution if they need help. You will need to change this to reflect your instituion:
   http://your-moodle-address/blocks/gsb/gsb_explained.htm

Important: You probably want to hide the GSB block from students but leave it visible for teachers, non-editing teachers etc. You can do this under: Site Admin > Users > Permissions > Define Roles   edit the student and guest roles and change block/gsb:viewgsb to Prevent.
		   
Please note: by default the GSB medals only processes and summarise courses in top level of Moodle categories - courses in sub categories are not counted or processed. The GSB can be changed to look at all courses. Please refer to the GSB forum on Moodle.org if you are interested in doing this (http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=134212)
